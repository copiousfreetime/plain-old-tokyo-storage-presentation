Plain Old Tokyo Storage

This is a talk about the Tokyo Cabinet suite of products and their use in a
production system.  

I will cover the basics of the Tokyo Cabinet suite of products and then dive
into the story of into Collective Intellect uses Tokyo Tyrant and Varnish 
in a production system to manage 1.3 TiB of xml documents.  These 1.8 Billion
(and growing) documents are stored in a cluster of Tokyo Tyrant hash databases,
fronted by a Varnish server, and configured with ruby programs.

Areas I will cover are: why we are using Tyrant, our backup and recovery
process, and our partitioning and scaling strategy.
