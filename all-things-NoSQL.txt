The 3rd step of {No}SQL

Everyone should remember the "old" adage of the 3 steps to a startup:

  1. Idea
  2. ???
  3. Profit

Those same 3 steps exist in all {No}SQL systems.  And yes, I use {No} because
its the same 3 steps if you are using a RDBMS fronted by a SQL engine.

  1. Data
  2. ???
  3. Store it in a B-Tree

When you look at data storage systems they all look pretty much the same.  You
take away all the servers, all the data manipulation language, the wire
protocols and say, "how do I persist this data to peramanent storeage?".  The
answer, overwhelmingly, is the classic B-Tree.

- Knuth B-Tree.
- Take a few of the NoSQL solutions, show the underlying storage
- Take a few of the SQL solutions, show the underlying storage

Tokyo Cabinet   - B-Tree is one of the items
MongoDB         - B-Tree
CouchDB         - B-Tree
Riak            - riak_fs_backend - stores on disk filesystem, which is probably a b-tree
Cassandra       -
